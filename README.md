1.0 COMMENT IN PYTHON

In general, writing comment means writing some text that defines your feeling or opinion or whatever you say about any particular thing. Similarly, comment in a Python program is used to provide description of a code, statement, or whole program.

Note - Comments in Python are human-readable or programmer-readable. That is, comment can't be read or interpreted by the compiler or interpreter.
What is a Comment in Python ?

So we can say, a comment is basically a human-readable explanation or annotation in the Python program. The explanation may be given of:

    any particular statement
    any block of code
    any piece of code
    sometime the whole program
    or whatever the programmer need to explanation the thing in the program

Note - Comment can also be used to comment out any code or block of code to skip its execution by the compiler. Therefore, a comment can also be used for practice or debug.

Note - Generally, comments are used to provide in-program description of the code.
Why to Use Comment in Python ?

Most of the time, comment in Python is used to make source code more easier for other programmer to understand, or even the creator of the program too to understand, while reading the code now or later.

Another use of comment in a Python program is, if you found that a block of code in your program is not executing or performing its work in correct way. Then instead of deleting that block of code, you can comment it out, and create another block of code. May be while creating another new block of code, the error gets catch up, so that, just un-comment the previous block of code, and modify it. That's it.

Comment also helps in reviewing the Python code later. So, this article tells you all about the use of comment in Python programming along with example program.
Types of Comment in Python

Python programming language provides two types of comment to use in the source code of the program, that are:

    Single-line comment
    Multi-line comment

Single-line Comment in Python

Single-line comment in Python is a comment that is written after hash symbol (#). That is, all characters after hash (#) sign referred as comment (single line comment), up to the physical line end. For example:

# I'm a single-line comment of Python

print("Hey!\nHow are you?")

# I'm also a single-line comment of Python

Multi-line Comment in Python

Multi-line comment is a comment that is written or expanded in more than one line or multiple lines. In Python, for multi-line comment, we use """ (triple quotes) or ''' (triple apostrophe). For example:

''' This is a
    multi-line comment
    in Python
'''

print("Hey\nHow're You?")

""" This is also a
    multi-line comment
    in Python
"""
